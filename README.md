# PinboardMCP
The Houston Bloom Pinboard MCP is a tool to build hyper local collective intelligence using Pinboard's public feeds. Participants tag public bookmarks with bloom-houston to contribute to a shared commons. Claude can then search community research, identify topic experts, and surface relationships between members.
